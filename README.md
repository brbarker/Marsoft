Welcome to MarSoft. The GDL library created for Ursinus College Physics Department.
 
Useful abbreviations to know:

       - RA = Right Ascension
       - RAh = Right Ascension Hour(s)
       - RAm = Right Ascension Minute(s)
       - RAs = Right Ascension Second(s)

       - Dec = Declination
       - DecD = Declination Degrees
       - DecM = Declination Minutes
       - DecS = Declination Seconds

 It contains a search feature with two options:
 
       - Search a .CSV file
               - The .CSV file columns must have the following format to be read properly:
                       - Source Name, RAh, RAm, RAs, DecD, DecM, DecS
       - Searching with Observation Time and Date

 It contains a calculation feature with five options:
 
       - Calculate Day of the Year, also known as Day of the Julian Calendar
       - Calculate Declination of the Mean Sun using either:
               - Day of the Julian Calendar
               - Days since Vernal Equinox
       - Calculate Right Ascension of the Mean Sun using either:
               - Day of the Julian Calendar
               - Days since Vernal Equinox
       - Telescope Calculations
               - Calculate Angular Magnification
               - Calculate Angular Resolution
               - Calculate Focal Ratio
               - Calculate Snell's Law For Angle Of Refraction
       - Solar System Distance Conversion
